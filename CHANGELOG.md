* Clean up NPM package (#2352)

# 1.0.1 (12.10.2016)

Accidentally released 1.0.1 to NPM, so we have to skip this version (added here to remove confusion)

# 1.0.0 (12.10.2016)

## Breaking Changes

* The HTTP Event now uses the [recently released Lambda Proxy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-set-up-simple-proxy.html#api-gateway-proxy-integration-types) by default. This requires you to change your handler result to fit the new proxy integration. You can also switch back to the old integration type.
* The Cloudformation Name of APIG paths that have a variable have changed, so if you have a variable in a path and redeploy CF will throw an error. To fix this remove the path and readd it a second deployment.
