**The Serverless Framework** – Build applications comprised of microservices that run in response to events, auto-scale for you, and only charge you when they run.  This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.

The Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google CloudFunctions, and more.  It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.

Serverless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team.

## <a name="quick-start"></a>Quick Start

[Watch the video guide here](https://serverless.com/framework/) or follow the steps below to create and deploy your first serverless microservice in minutes.

* ##### Install via npm:
  * `npm install -g serverless`

* ##### Set-up your [Provider Credentials](./docs/02-providers/aws/01-setup.md)

* ##### Create a Service:
  * Creates a new Serverless Service/Project
  * `serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-service`
  * `cd my-service`

* ##### Or Install a Service:
  *  This is a convenience method to install a pre-made Serverless Service locally by downloading the Github repo and unzipping it.  Services are listed below.
  * `serverless install -u [GITHUB URL OF SERVICE]`

* ##### Deploy a Service:
  * Use this when you have made changes to your Functions, Events or Resources in `serverless.yml` or you simply want to deploy all changes within your Service at the same time.
  * `serverless deploy -v`

* ##### Deploy Function:
  * Use this to quickly upload and overwrite your AWS Lambda code on AWS, allowing you to develop faster.
  * `serverless deploy function -f myfunction`

* ##### Invoke a Function:
  * Invokes an AWS Lambda Function on AWS and returns logs.
  * `serverless invoke -f hello -l`

* ##### Fetch Function Logs:
  * Open up a separate tab in your console and stream all logs for a specific Function using this command.
  * `serverless logs -f hello -t`

* ##### Remove a Service:
  * Removes all Functions, Events and Resources from your AWS account.
  * `serverless remove`

## <a name="why-serverless"></a>Why Serverless?

We want to make sure that you and your team don't have to manage or think about Servers in your day to day development. Through AWS Lambda and similar Function as a Service providers you can focus on building your business code without having to worry about operations. While there are of course still servers running, you don't have to think about them. This turns you into a Serverless Team and thats why we think Serverless is a fitting name.

## <a name="contributing"></a>Contributing
